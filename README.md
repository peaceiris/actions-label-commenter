## Label Commenter Action

This action is one of label triggered GitHub Actions for posting a template message. After commenting, it can automatically close or reopen issues. Of course, it also can manage pull requests.

This Action was submitted to the [GitHub Actions Hackathon] and featured by GitHub. ([Featured actions from the GitHub Actions Hackathon - The GitHub Blog])

## Getting Started

Create your GitHub Actions workflow file and Label Commenter Action setting file. Commit those and push to the remote master branch.

### Workflow Setting

```yaml
# .github/workflows/label-commenter.yml

name: Label Commenter

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled
      - unlabeled
  pull_request:
    types:
      - labeled
      - unlabeled

jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: Label Commenter
        uses: peaceiris/actions-label-commenter@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # config_file: .github/label-commenter-config.yml
```

For the `pull_request` event from forks, we need to use a personal access token instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` on a fork has no write permission. See the official documentation for more details. [Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token)
